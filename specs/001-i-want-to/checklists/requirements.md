# Specification Quality Checklist: Fast Metra Train Tracker

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

**Details**:
- Content Quality: All items passed. Spec focuses on user needs without technical implementation details. GTFS API is mentioned as a data source constraint (given by user) but no framework/language specifics included.
- Requirement Completeness: All items passed. No clarifications needed - reasonable assumptions made for ambiguous areas (documented in Assumptions section). All requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria.
- Feature Readiness: All items passed. Three prioritized user stories with independent test criteria. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (focuses on user-facing outcomes like "within 3 seconds" rather than backend metrics).

**Specific Strengths**:
- Clear performance targets aligned with constitution Performance Requirements principle
- User stories are properly prioritized and independently testable
- Edge cases comprehensively identified with proposed handling
- Out of scope section prevents feature creep
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults

**Notes**:
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` - no clarifications or revisions needed
- Performance targets (3-5 second response times) align with constitution principle IV
- PWA requirement supports UX consistency principle III (responsive, offline capable)
