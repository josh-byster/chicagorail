# Feature Specification: Fast Metra Train Tracker

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create an app that, a progressive web app that allows users to track the current state of metro trains using the GTFS API that I have a key for and like figure out what the times are very quickly. Like I'm very much focused on making it really like quick for users to access information. Like right now, the current apps really lack in terms of like it takes a while to select like what line you want to go to. And like I really want to be able to see like I want to go from this like place to this place and instantly see like the trains that are available, like upcoming and like be able to drill down and see like how far they are, etc. And all of that type of stuff. But like really focus on like very quickly getting the information to the user."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick Route Lookup (Priority: P1)

Commuter wants to instantly see upcoming trains from their current station to their destination without navigating through multiple menus or screens.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - speed of access to critical information. Commuters need this information immediately, especially when running late or making time-sensitive decisions.

**Independent Test**: User can input origin and destination stations and see upcoming train times within 3 seconds from app launch.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens the app for the first time, **When** they select origin station "Ogilvie Transportation Center" and destination station "Arlington Heights", **Then** they see a list of upcoming trains with departure times, arrival times, and platform numbers
2. **Given** user has previously searched a route, **When** they open the app, **Then** their last-used route is automatically displayed with current train times
3. **Given** user is viewing upcoming trains, **When** they select a specific train, **Then** they see detailed information including all stops, current train position, and estimated delays

### User Story 2 - Real-Time Train Status (Priority: P2)

Commuter wants to see the current location and status of their train to know if it's on time, delayed, or approaching their station.

**Why this priority**: Real-time tracking prevents missed trains and reduces platform wait anxiety. Users can time their arrival at the station more accurately.

**Independent Test**: User can see live train position updates and delay notifications for their selected route without manual refresh.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is viewing a specific train, **When** the train's position updates, **Then** the map/progress indicator updates automatically without requiring manual refresh
2. **Given** a train is delayed, **When** user views that train, **Then** they see the delay duration and updated arrival time prominently displayed
3. **Given** user's train is approaching their station, **When** train is within 5 minutes, **Then** user receives a visual notification

---

### User Story 3 - Saved Routes & Favorites (Priority: P3)

Commuter wants to save frequently used routes (home to work, work to home) for instant one-tap access.

**Why this priority**: Regular commuters use the same 2-3 routes daily. Saving these eliminates repetitive input and enables sub-second access to relevant information.

**Independent Test**: User can save routes and access them with a single tap from the home screen.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has searched for a route, **When** they tap "Save Route", **Then** the route appears in their favorites list with a custom label
2. **Given** user has saved routes, **When** they open the app, **Then** they see their favorite routes as quick-access buttons showing next available train times
3. **Given** user has multiple saved routes, **When** they tap a favorite, **Then** they immediately see current train times without re-entering stations

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no trains are currently scheduled (late night/early morning)?
  - Display next available train time and "No trains currently scheduled" message
- How does the system handle when a station has multiple platforms/tracks?
  - Display platform/track number for each train clearly
- What happens when GTFS API is unavailable or returns errors?
  - Show cached data with timestamp indicating last update + error message
- How does the system handle when user's location services are disabled?
  - Allow manual station selection; prompt to enable location for auto-detection
- What happens when a train is cancelled?
  - Mark train as "Cancelled" with red indicator and show next available alternative

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display upcoming train times for a selected origin and destination station pair
- **FR-002**: System MUST fetch and display real-time train data from GTFS API
- **FR-003**: System MUST show train departure time, arrival time, line name, and platform number for each upcoming train
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to view detailed information for a specific train including all stops and current position
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically update train times and positions without requiring manual refresh
- **FR-006**: System MUST display train delays and service alerts prominently
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to select stations quickly through search or recent selections
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to save frequently used routes with custom labels
- **FR-009**: System MUST remember user's last-searched route and display it on app launch
- **FR-010**: System MUST work offline by showing cached data with last-update timestamp
- **FR-011**: System MUST function as a Progressive Web App (installable, works offline, fast loading)
- **FR-012**: System MUST display current train position visually (map or progress indicator)
- **FR-013**: System MUST notify users when their train is approaching (within 5 minutes of arrival)
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **FR-015**: System MUST support all Metra lines and stations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Station**: Represents a Metra station with name, location coordinates, lines served, and platform information
- **Route**: A saved pair of origin and destination stations with optional custom label (e.g., "Home to Work")
- **Train**: Represents a scheduled train service with departure/arrival times, line, current position, delay status, and platform
- **Line**: Represents a Metra rail line (e.g., Union Pacific North, BNSF Railway) with stations served and schedule
- **Service Alert**: Represents delays, cancellations, or service disruptions affecting specific trains or lines

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can view upcoming train times within 3 seconds of opening the app (for returning users with saved routes) or within 5 seconds for first-time searches
- **SC-002**: Train time information is accurate and synchronized with GTFS API data with updates no more than 30 seconds stale
- **SC-003**: App loads initial screen in under 2 seconds on standard mobile network (4G)
- **SC-004**: 90% of users successfully complete their primary task (finding train times for a route) on first attempt without assistance
- **SC-005**: Users with saved routes can access their train times in 1 tap or less from home screen
- **SC-006**: App remains functional and displays cached data when offline, with clear indication of data staleness
- **SC-007**: App successfully handles 100% of GTFS API error scenarios without crashing
- **SC-008**: Train position updates reflect real-time location with accuracy within 1 station
- **SC-009**: Users can navigate entire app using only keyboard or screen reader (accessibility compliance)
- **SC-010**: Page load and interaction times remain under 3 seconds even with 20+ simultaneous train schedules displayed

### Assumptions

- GTFS API provides real-time train position data (not just static schedules)
- GTFS API has reasonable rate limits that support polling every 30 seconds
- Users primarily access app on mobile devices (phones/tablets)
- Metra stations and lines are relatively stable (infrequent additions/changes)
- Users have internet connectivity most of the time but need offline fallback
- Target users are regular Metra commuters familiar with station names and lines
- Push notifications are not required initially (visual notifications sufficient)
- User authentication/accounts are not required for basic functionality
- Location services are optional enhancement, not core requirement

## Out of Scope *(optional - remove if not needed)*

The following are explicitly NOT included in this feature:

- Ticket purchase or payment processing
- Multi-modal transportation (buses, other transit systems)
- Social features (sharing routes, commuter chat)
- Historical data analysis or pattern prediction
- Route planning with transfers (initial version is direct routes only)
- User accounts or cloud synchronization across devices
- Push notifications (future enhancement)
- Integration with calendar or other apps
