# Tasks: Fast Metra Train Tracker

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-i-want-to/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api.openapi.yaml

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the spec, so test tasks are omitted per template guidance.

**MCP Tools**: This project REQUIRES using MCP tools:
- **ShadCN UI MCP**: Use `mcp__shadcn__getComponent` before implementing ANY ShadCN component (see CLAUDE.md for details)
- **Ref MCP**: Use `mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation` for searching library documentation (TanStack Query, node-gtfs, Workbox, etc.)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, Setup, Foundation)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
This is a monorepo project with:
- **Shared types**: `packages/shared/src/`
- **Backend**: `packages/backend/src/`
- **Frontend**: `packages/frontend/src/`

- [ ] T089 [US2] Handle offline scenario: show cached data with staleness indicator in packages/frontend/src/components/TrainList/TrainList.tsx

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - users can search routes AND see realtime status

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Saved Routes & Favorites (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Users can save frequently used routes for instant one-tap access.

**Independent Test**: User can save routes and access them with a single tap from the home screen.

**Required Entities**: SavedRoute (client-side only)
**Required Endpoints**: None (fully client-side implementation)

- [ ] T102 [US3] Fetch and display next train time for each saved route in SavedRouteCard using useTrains hook

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional - MVP complete with all P1, P2, P3 features

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion - CAN run in parallel with US1 with separate developer
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) and User Story 1 (needs train query functionality) - CAN run in parallel with US2
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories - Can start after Foundational
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: No dependencies on US1 - Can start after Foundational (enhances existing train display)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Soft dependency on US1 (uses train query functionality) - Should start after US1 complete or run in parallel with coordination

### Within Each User Story

**Backend First Approach**:
1. Backend services before API endpoints
2. API endpoints before frontend integration
3. Core functionality before caching/optimization

**Frontend Flow**:
1. Install ShadCN components needed
2. Create atomic components (TrainListItem, StationSelect)
3. Create composite components (TrainList, RouteSearch)
4. Create pages (HomePage, TrainDetailPage)
5. Add routing and state management
6. Add caching and offline support

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T004, T005, T006, T007, T008, T009, T010 can all run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundation)**:
- Shared, Backend, Frontend package initialization can run in parallel (T011-T013, T014-T015, T025-T029)
- Type definitions (T037-T041) can all run in parallel
- Once Express app is setup (T016), middleware tasks (T017, T018, T019) can run in parallel

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- Backend services (T044, T045) can run in parallel
- ShadCN component installations (T052, T053, T054) can run in parallel
- Frontend atomic components can run in parallel after ShadCN components ready

**Phase 4 (US2)**:
- Backend services (T069, T070) can run in parallel
- ShadCN component installations (T077, T078) can run in parallel

**Phase 5 (US3)**:
- ShadCN component installations (T092, T093) can run in parallel
- Frontend components can be built in parallel with coordination

**Phase 6 (Polish)**: Most polish tasks (T103-T112, T114-T119) can run in parallel

**Multi-Story Parallelization**:
- Once Foundational (Phase 2) is complete, US1 and US2 can be developed in parallel by different developers
- US3 can start once US1's train query functionality is complete

---

## Parallel Example: Foundation Phase

```bash
# After Express app setup (T016), launch middleware tasks together:
Task T017: "Create error-handler.ts middleware"
Task T018: "Create logger.ts middleware"
Task T019: "Create cors.ts middleware"

# Launch all type definition tasks together:
Task T037: "Define Station interface and schema"
Task T038: "Define Line interface and schema"
Task T039: "Define Train interface and schema"
Task T040: "Define StopTime interface and schema"
Task T041: "Define ServiceAlert interface and schema"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch backend services together:
Task T044: "Create Station service"
Task T045: "Create Train service"

# Launch ShadCN installations together:
Task T052: "Install ShadCN Select component"
Task T053: "Install ShadCN Card component"
Task T054: "Install ShadCN Button component"

# After services ready, launch API endpoints together:
Task T046: "Create GET /stations endpoint"
Task T047: "Create GET /stations/:stationId endpoint"
Task T048: "Create GET /trains endpoint"
Task T049: "Create GET /trains/:tripId endpoint"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

**Fastest path to value**:

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (~2-3 hours)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (~1-2 days) - CRITICAL, blocks everything
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (~2-3 days)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test route lookup end-to-end
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**Total MVP Time Estimate**: 4-5 days for single developer

### Incremental Delivery

**Recommended approach for production**:

1. **Week 1**: Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. **Week 2**: User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! üéØ)
   - Users can search routes and see train times
3. **Week 3**: User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
   - Adds realtime tracking and delay notifications
4. **Week 4**: User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
   - Adds saved routes for power users
5. **Week 5**: Polish ‚Üí Production-ready system

Each user story adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

**With 2-3 developers**:

1. **All developers**: Complete Setup + Foundational together (1 week)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (route lookup)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (realtime status) - requires coordination with A for train display components
   - **Developer C**: Setup Polish tasks (monitoring, performance, accessibility)
3. **Developer C**: User Story 3 (saved routes) once US1 is complete
4. **All developers**: Final integration, testing, and deployment polish

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 120 tasks
**By Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 10 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundation): 33 tasks
- Phase 3 (US1 - Quick Route Lookup): 23 tasks
- Phase 4 (US2 - Real-Time Status): 23 tasks
- Phase 5 (US3 - Saved Routes): 13 tasks
- Phase 6 (Polish): 18 tasks

**By User Story**:
- User Story 1 (P1 - Quick Route Lookup): 23 tasks ‚Üí MVP core functionality
- User Story 2 (P2 - Real-Time Status): 23 tasks ‚Üí Realtime enhancements
- User Story 3 (P3 - Saved Routes): 13 tasks ‚Üí Power user feature

**Parallel Opportunities**: 50+ tasks marked [P] for parallel execution

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- **US1**: Can search origin/destination and see upcoming trains in <5 seconds
- **US2**: Can see train delays and position updates every 30 seconds automatically
- **US3**: Can save a route and access it with 1 tap showing current train times

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only) = 66 tasks

---

## Notes

- **MCP Tools REQUIRED**: Always use `mcp__shadcn__getComponent` before implementing ShadCN components and `mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation` for library documentation lookups (see CLAUDE.md for full details)
- Tests are omitted as they were not explicitly requested in the feature specification
- All [P] tasks indicate different files with no dependencies - safe for parallel execution
- Each user story is independently testable and deployable
- Foundation phase (Phase 2) is CRITICAL - must complete before any user story work begins
- User Story 1 delivers core MVP value - prioritize completing it first
- User Stories 2 and 3 are enhancements that can be added incrementally
- Commit after each task or logical group of tasks
- Use checkpoints to validate each story works independently before proceeding
- Monitor performance targets: API p95 <200ms, initial load <2s, bundle <500KB gzipped
- üí° Look for emoji lightbulbs (üí°) in tasks - they indicate where to use MCP tools
